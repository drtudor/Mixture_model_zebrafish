# Mixture_model_zebrafish
Bayesian inference mixture model for understanding how mixtures of parameters can be used to understand the number of immune cells present in a system

This model will be a continuation of the work in the Immune Cell Migration repo but with the exception that it will focus on leukocyte behaviour in zebrafish and will incorporate mixed models for Bayesian inference
